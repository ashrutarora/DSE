Hello world! This is a sample text file.
We are testing the Pig script in local and MapReduce modes.
Pig is a high-level platform for processing large datasets.
It provides a simple scripting language called Pig Latin.

In Pig Latin, you can express data transformations using a series of operations.
These operations include loading data, transforming it, and storing the results.

Pig is often used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes in big data analytics.
It abstracts the complexity of MapReduce programming, making it easier to work with large-scale data.

Happy coding with Pig!
