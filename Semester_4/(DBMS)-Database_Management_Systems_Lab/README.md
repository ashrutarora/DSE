# Employee Management System
This is a database schema for an Employee Management System, which consists of several tables that store information about employees, their skills, projects they work on, their work experience, family dependents, medical policies, and paychecks.

### NOTE : My implementation might be different from how you might implement it, so you might have to do minor changes as per your codes.
#### If something doesent work then try checking how the table was created and check the Positions of the Columns.
