    <h2>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
    <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee, an esteemed British computer scientist and the inventor of the World Wide Web, laid the
      foundation for the modern digital age with his groundbreaking idea of a globally interconnected information
      system. As a pivotal figure in the development of the Web, Sir Tim played an instrumental role in founding W3C to
      oversee and guide its growth. His dedication to an open and accessible internet has profoundly influenced the way
